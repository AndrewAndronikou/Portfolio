                            An assignment as part of my Games & AI module in University which I was awarded with a first class, and was the most enjoyable module I completed. The assignment required me to create any game of my choosing with gameplay mechanics and two AI techniques. I decided to create an RPG as there are lots of features which can be created in order to make it fun, I created; weapon system, leveling system, finite state machine, flocking, random enemy spawner. The way I designed and created this project allowed for the framework to very extendable and I am also currently in the process of taking this project further and extending it to create a full RPG game with different levels, invetory system and questing.<br><br>
