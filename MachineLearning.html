                            First introduced to me during my Internship in Munich, the more I explore this area the more fascinated I became. Created using Python, Tensorflow, Yolov3 and more API's. By feeding in very large amounts of data I was able to achieve some very interesting results.

                            As autonomous cars and machine learning are a very hot area of exploration currently, I decided to explore this are more myself. Having trained my algorithm on a dataset of images that are related to road and traffic, I was able to create some accurate results by feeding in videos to my algorithm to achieve the following. Also, by extending this algorithm I was able to produce the same for real-time rendering by using a webcam which is the same principles as real world autonomous vehicles use.

                                This is another method I explored to train a vehicle to drive autonomously, by feeding in data from myself driving around the track the algorithm was able to learn and "mimic" this behaviour. By improving the data set provided to these algorithms will increase the overall accuracy within the output, as I was limited to keyboard controls this drastically limited the accurate data.
