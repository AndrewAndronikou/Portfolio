                            As I have plenty of experience with Unity due to this being the prefered Engine in University, I felt that it was only right to branch out and to learn Unreal Engine 4, this was definately a challenge and took some time getting used to. However, I am very happy I stuck with it, this powerful engine has allowed me to broaden my knowledge of different workflows, along with their advantages and disadvantages. <br><br>
                            
                            Therefor I felt it was important to create a game which played to its strong points, a simple 3rd Person shooter. Also, by being fully open source it allowed me to look deep into the innerworkings of Unreal and massively improve my knowledge of C++ along with performance and solid coding standards.
