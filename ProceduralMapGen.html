                            An assignment as part of my Advanced 3D Graphics Programming module which I was awarded with a first class. The assignment required me to create an algorithm capable of procedurally creating environments, this was written in C++ OpenGL. The environment is created using the diamond square algorithms to create the mesh, the scene includes animated water, heightmaps, lighting and free flying camera.<br><br>
