                            3D Art is something I enjoy, as I can just sit down and let my imagination run free to create exactly what I require, this is my preferred method to create assets for any games I create. I am able to use both 3DS Max and Blender with Vray to create base models, I then export to Substance Painter to finish it off with texturing.
                            <br><br>
                            This was part of a University project revolving around creating 3D environments and a vehicle which I was awarded with a first class for my work, I ensured that everything I was creating was not to high poly count as I always  ensure that any assets I create are ready to be added into any Game Engine without causing any performance issues.<br><br>
