                            Currently work in progress, being actively developed constantly so be sure to keep an eye on the develop branch of my GitHub repo to see the latest changes! This will be similar to the mobile platformers you know, below is just a quick showcase of a sandbox level testing some features I have been implementing. I have a large list of features which are planned, and I am looking forward to showing you how this game is evolving.  <br><br>
