                            A very enjoyable personal project which I had lots of fun creating and learning new concepts, as this was my first complete and released game I wanted to challenge myself. All assets were created by myself (except audio) in; 3DS Max, Substance painter and Photoshop. This is a tower defense game and has varying levels with increasing difficulty, complimented with a shop where the player can buy, upgrade and sell turrets to fit their playstyle, in order to defeat many waves of different enemy types. This was definitely a challenge but an enjoyable engaging one, this encouraged me to push myself to learn and explore areas of game development which were never taught during my degree.<br><br>

                             Check out the full published game out on <a href = "https://andayy.itch.io/data-defense" target = "none" style="color: #0000EE;">itch.io </a> <br>
